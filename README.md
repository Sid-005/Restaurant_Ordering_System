# Restaurant_Ordering_System
This project aims to create a text-based user interface presenting a working model of a restaurant ordering system using Python3.
Designed as a semester-end mini-project.
Name of restaurant is "Asian Confusion".

PRE-REQUISITES:
1. Download all text files included in the repository
2. Stable verions of Python3 (versions 3.6 or later)
3. Operating System: Windows 10 or later, Linux, MacOS
4. Text editors to ensure that text formatting is consistent (since it is text-based User Interface)

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This mini project allows a user to place an order, review the sales of dishes utlizing this system, view the number of people who have bought each dish,
or edit items within the menu. It stores and accesses data within text files (compulsory requirement for project) which are accessed using the open() method in Python3.

Some key functions are:
  - A function to allow the user to view all the items in the menu
  - Function to allow the user to place an order
  - Function to allow the user to view the sales information of the restaurant (by means of day, week, month, year and custom range)
  - Function that enables users to see a ranking of the dishes by using their counts as parameters to arrange each menu item in descending order. 
     Most popular dish shall be placed on top and the least popular dish shall be found in the bottom.
  - Function that allows the user to add/delete/update an item within in the menu.
  - Function to give the users access to a discount coupon, provided they spend more than an amount set in advance (100 dollars) and are willing to perform a particular 
     action (follow instagram accounts of the creators in this case)
 
 NOTE: No module has been used for the creation of this project
